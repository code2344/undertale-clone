Undertale Clone - Complete Game Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation strategy for building a complete
Undertale clone from the decompilation data.

## Phase 1: Core Engine (Priority 1)
- [ ] JSON data loaders (rooms, objects, sprites, backgrounds)
- [ ] Resource manager (caching, loading assets)
- [ ] Room renderer (tiles, backgrounds, objects)
- [ ] Sprite system with animation
- [ ] Collision detection system

## Phase 2: Game Systems (Priority 2)
- [ ] Object interaction system
- [ ] Room transition system
- [ ] Character controller
- [ ] Camera/viewport system
- [ ] Save/load system integration

## Phase 3: Game Content (Priority 3)
- [ ] Menu system (full implementation)
- [ ] Battle system
- [ ] Dialogue system
- [ ] NPC system
- [ ] Item system

## Phase 4: Complete Integration (Priority 4)
- [ ] All rooms functional
- [ ] All game mechanics working
- [ ] Testing and debugging
- [ ] Browser build optimization

## Technical Approach
1. Create modular loaders for each JSON type
2. Build asset pipeline for sprites/backgrounds
3. Implement room system that can load ANY room from JSON
4. Add game logic layer on top of rendering
5. Iterate and test with increasing complexity

## Timeline Estimate
- Phase 1: 6-8 hours
- Phase 2: 4-6 hours  
- Phase 3: 8-12 hours
- Phase 4: 4-6 hours
Total: ~24-32 hours of focused development

## Current Status
Starting Phase 1...
